# Running the backend (recommended)

The recommended way to start the server is to use your favorite java IDE.
Import the project as maven project, install the libraries, I used Spring boot, to run use the command: spring-boot: run, and the server will boot automatically.
The main method of the application is in the App class.
The project is configured with Swagger also, if you wanted to see the application by Swagger, you only need to access:
Http: // localhost: 8080 / swagger-ui.html

# Running the frontend (recommended)

I used react for the front end, to initialize you need to go to the ReactStarter folder (from the command prompt), run npm install to install the necessary libraries, then just run npm start and the application will open in the link:
Http: // localhost: 3000

For this project I used Spring-boot, Spring MVC, JUnit, Swagger, and React.
